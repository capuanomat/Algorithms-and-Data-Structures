            DFS (Stack): ...

            BFS (Queue): Fewest # of edges path from one vertex to another
                         Also shortest path if all edges have same weight

            Uniform Cost Search (Priority Queue): Shortest path from one vertex to another

            Dijkstra's (Priority Queue): Shortest path from one vertex to every other vertex

            Bellman-Ford (...): Shortest path from one vertex to ever other vertex
                                           Works with negative edge weights

            Floyd-Warshall (...): Shortest path between every pair of vertices
                                  Works with negative edge weights

            A*: Uniform Cost Search with a heuristic
