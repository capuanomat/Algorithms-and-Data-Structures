# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Repository for all basic and advanced Algorithms I have implemented and/or studied.

Under the Java directory you will find:
- Sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Radix Sort (TO BE ADDED)
- Data Structures (The actual implementation of data structures, TO BE ADDED)
- Java Data Structures Libraries  (This is examples for using built-in Java libraries)
  - ArrayLists
  - Linked Lists (TO BE ADDED)
  - ...
- Notes and practice problems on Strings
- Notes on Java Programming in general

Under the Python directory you will find (TO BE ADDED):
- DFS
- BFS
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Greedy Best First Search (GBFS)
- A* (which is the same as Best First Search but *with* the admissibility requirement on heuristics)
