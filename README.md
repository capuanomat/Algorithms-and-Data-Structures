# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Repository for all basic and advanced Algorithms I have implemented and/or studied.

Under the Java directory you will find:
...

Under the Python directory you will find (Eventually):
- DFS
- BFS
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Greedy Best First Search (GBFS)
- A* (which is the same as Best First Search but *with* the admissibility requirement on heuristics)
